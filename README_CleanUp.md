# Clean Up Notes
## Deletion of various files/folders which includes:
- (Folder) assets
- assets > logo.svg
- primary > App.css
- primary > App.jsx
- primary > main.jsx
- background > main.js
- (Folder) options
- options > App.css
- options > App.jsx
- options > index.html
- options > main.jsx
- (Folder) contentScript
- contentScript > renderContent.js
- enableDevHmr.js
- popup > components > PageContent.css
- popup > App.css
- dist > icons
- public > icons
- ALL icons

Background script doesn't seem to be working as intended. For now, it's best to have entry into the main extension through the popup.
